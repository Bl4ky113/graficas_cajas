# Graficas Cajas

Part of the Project Revisitando_Proyectos. The Original project was made in the middle of the 2020 academic year for my mathematics teacher, Abdon.

## The Original Proyect

It's an proyect were I made with very primitive, repetitive and bad-written Javascript, CSS and HTML5, the graphical interpretations of __Box Functions__. Or Mathematical functions
wich let me get the measures of a box without top, made out with a sheet of paper. These graphs, I made them using the Canvas API.

But hey, the teacher gave me a 5, or the best note in my school.

When I think it's been a little bit more than a year when I made this proyect, it's so nostalgic. And makes me wonder about the future and how much I've improved in this 
world of coding and web dessign.
